# API Configuration
# The backend API URL. 
# In development, this defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8000
# In production, it uses the same origin as the frontend (window.location.origin)
# Uncomment and set this if you need to override the default behavior:
# VITE_API_URL=https://thetimpc-1.ancon-boa.ts.net/api
